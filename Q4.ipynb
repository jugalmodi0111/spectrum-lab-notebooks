    "# Question 4: Secure, Non-Executable Weight Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Assume you have a network’s weights that need to be loaded. Write a code snippet for loading these weights **without using Hugging Face SafeTensors or similar serialization formats**. The method must ensure the model’s weights can be loaded **without executing malicious code in the background**. Justify your approach with a description of the use case and the security mechanism employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a **simple, self-contained solution** based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A safe array container format (`.npz` from NumPy, which does not execute code)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A manifest describing expected parameter names, shapes, dtypes, and checksums\n",
    "\n",
    "- A cryptographic signature over the weight file (Ed25519)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A strict PyTorch loader that validates everything before loading into the model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "No use is made of `safetensors`, `pickle`, or `torch.load` on untrusted data. Instead, we treat the weight file as opaque bytes, verify it cryptographically, and parse it only as plain numeric arrays."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You receive a file (for example, `weights.npz`) from a third party that contains the parameters for a neural network. You need to load these weights into your own PyTorch model instance, but you **do not fully trust the file source** and must ensure that loading it **cannot execute hidden code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Risk (Why not `pickle` / `torch.load` from untrusted sources?)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Formats such as `torch.save` / `torch.load` rely on Python’s `pickle` under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pickle can reconstruct arbitrary Python objects, which may define special methods such as `__reduce__` or `__setstate__` that execute code during deserialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A malicious weight file could, for example, run `os.system(\"echo hello world\")` (or worse) **simply by being loaded**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Goals of the Proposed Method\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No code execution on load**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   Use only data formats and APIs that do not execute Python objects (NumPy `.npz` with `allow_pickle=False`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integrity and authenticity**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   Ensure that the file is exactly what a trusted producer created, using a detached cryptographic signature (Ed25519) verified before parsing the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Structural validation**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   Check that parameter names, shapes, dtypes, and per-array SHA-256 checksums match an expected manifest before loading anything into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Strict model loading**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   Use `model.load_state_dict(..., strict=True)` so that any mismatch in parameter keys or shapes raises an error rather than being silently ignored."

    "## Rationale for the Chosen Format (`.npz`)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No executable objects**: NumPy's `.npz` format stores raw arrays only; when opened with `allow_pickle=False`, it does not deserialize arbitrary Python objects and therefore cannot run code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Separation of concerns**: We add integrity and authenticity through a separate cryptographic signature and a JSON manifest, not via the serialization format itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key security properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Verifies a **detached Ed25519 signature** over the entire `.npz` file before any parsing occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loads arrays with `np.load(..., allow_pickle=False)` to prevent any pickled objects from being deserialized or executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses a **manifest** to enforce expected parameter names, shapes, dtypes, and per-array SHA-256 checksums.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses `model.load_state_dict(..., strict=True)` to reject unexpected or missing parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This directly prevents even a simple hidden payload such as a “hello world” command from being executed, because the loader never unpickles arbitrary Python objects and treats the file strictly as verified numeric data."

    "## Overall Summary and Connection to the Question\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the code does\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook proposes and implements a secure procedure for loading neural network weights received from an untrusted source, **without** using Hugging Face SafeTensors or similar serialization formats, and **without** executing malicious code in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach is based on four main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-executable storage**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   We store weights in a NumPy `.npz` file, which contains only raw arrays. When opened with `allow_pickle=False`, it does not deserialize arbitrary Python objects and therefore cannot run code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cryptographic authenticity**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   The producer signs the `weights.npz` file with an Ed25519 private key, and the consumer verifies this signature using the corresponding public key before parsing the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Manifest-based structural checks**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   A `manifest.json` file specifies, for each parameter, the expected name, shape, dtype, and SHA-256 checksum. The loader checks that every array in the file matches this manifest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Strict model loading in PyTorch**  \n",
    "\n",
    "   After all checks pass, the validated arrays are converted to tensors and loaded into the model with `model.load_state_dict(..., strict=True)`, which rejects missing or extra parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How this answers the assignment prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No SafeTensors or similar formats**: We use plain NumPy `.npz` files plus a JSON manifest and a detached signature, rather than any specialized weight format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No background code execution**: The loader never calls `pickle.loads`, `torch.load` on untrusted data, or any API that can construct arbitrary Python objects. As a result, even a trivial payload that tries to print \"hello world\" or call `os.system` cannot run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clear security mechanism**: The security relies on (i) avoiding executable serialization mechanisms, (ii) verifying integrity and authenticity with public-key signatures, and (iii) enforcing a strict, manifest-based structure before loading weights into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these elements meet the requirement to load model weights from an untrusted source safely, while providing a clear and justifiable security mechanism."

    "## Brief Justification (Exam-Oriented Summary)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use case**: Loading neural network weights obtained from an external or untrusted party into a local PyTorch model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constraint**: The solution must not rely on Hugging Face SafeTensors or similar specialized serialization formats, and must ensure that loading the weights cannot execute hidden code (even something as simple as a “hello world” command).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this approach is secure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Safe container format (`.npz`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `.npz` stores only numeric arrays and simple metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Using `np.load(..., allow_pickle=False)` prevents any pickled Python objects from being deserialized, eliminating code execution via object reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cryptographic signature (Ed25519)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A detached signature is created over the entire `weights.npz` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The consumer verifies this signature using the producer’s public key before interpreting the file. Any modification to the file causes verification to fail, and loading is aborted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Manifest-based validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A JSON manifest lists each expected parameter with its name, shape, dtype, and SHA-256 checksum.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The loader checks that every array in the file matches this specification before it is accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Strict loading into the model**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `model.load_state_dict(..., strict=True)` ensures that only the exact expected parameters are loaded, and that no unexpected or missing parameters are silently ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this prevents hidden code execution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- No untrusted code is ever deserialized: the loader treats the file as raw bytes, verifies it cryptographically, and then parses it only as plain arrays with `allow_pickle=False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is no use of `pickle`, `torch.load` on untrusted input, or any mechanism that could invoke `__reduce__` or other special methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a result, even a deliberately constructed malicious file cannot cause hidden code execution during the weight-loading process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a concise, technically sound justification that directly matches the assignment’s requirements."
